# THVC Provider Directory Frontend Challenge 

TELUS Health Virtual Care (THVC) is an alternative way to access primary care health services in Canada. Think of it as a “virtual walk-in clinic”, but without any wait and better follow-up care. We provide on-demand primary care to more than 2.8 million Canadians.

Recently, THVC has expanded its suite of services to include allied health — services that go beyond primary care and that we’ve launched to support our patients’ wellness goals. We now offer mental health therapy, psychology, nutrition, physiotherapy and naturopathy services. These services are accessible by appointment only. To book an appointment, patients currently need to log onto the app and start a chat with an intake coordinator. The intake coordinator then proceeds to create the booking using the appointment booking feature in our clinical platform. 

In 2020-2021, the number and types of allied health services have grown, as did the number of bookings overall. While it’s great that we can give patients access to a wider set of services, there have been some pain points for our intake coordinators and our patients:
Our intake coordinators are now spending more time doing bookings (which is an administrative task), which leaves them with less time helping our patients and providing clinical care.
Our current booking process can be confusing for our intake coordinators and difficult for them to find a provider’s availability.
Because the number of services and allied health providers has grown, intake coordinators have difficulty recommending the appropriate provider for the needs of the patient.

We are updating our apps to allow patients to browse our specialists, and book their own appointments directly. Your job is to implement a part of the booking process, the provider listing and proifiles, in our patient app to be more efficient and to support our patients’ needs and goals.

The considerations:
- Create a small react app that allows us to interact with the requested screens.
- You can use your preferred styling framework - css, less, scss, styled-components, etc.
- We are providing you with mobile and desktop views, however you do not have to create responsive views - feel free to just do one or the other we are just including them both to give you options.

## Available Scripts

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
